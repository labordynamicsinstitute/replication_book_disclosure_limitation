# Replication archive for: Disclosure Limitation and Confidentiality Protection in Linked Data by Abowd, Schmutte, Vilhuber

Most of the data referenced in the book chapter are not original to this publication. One graph is based on confidential data, and the data underlying it cannot easily be made public. 

Data are organized by figure sequence in the article. Where appropriate, the original source of the graph is noted. Most of the original sources do NOT have a replication archive associated with it.
